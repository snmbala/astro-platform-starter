# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post built with **Astro** and deployed on **Netlify**! You can edit this content directly in the Netlify Visual Editor.

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites with less JavaScript. Here's why it's great:

- **Zero JS by default** - Ship less JavaScript to your users
- **Component islands** - Interactive components only where needed  
- **Framework agnostic** - Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any framework
- **Great developer experience** - Fast builds and hot module replacement

### Key Features

1. **Performance First** - Astro automatically optimizes your site
2. **Content Collections** - Built-in content management
3. **Island Architecture** - Only hydrate what needs to be interactive

## Getting Started

All your blog posts are stored in the `content/blog` directory as Markdown files. Each post has frontmatter metadata at the top and the content below.

You can add images, format text with **bold** and *italic*, create lists, and more!

### How to Edit

Simply click on any text in the Netlify Visual Editor to start editing. You can:

- Change the title and description
- Add or remove tags
- Format text with headings, lists, and styles
- Insert images from your media library

Happy blogging! 🚀
